Very nice smtp server.

Key features:

* is a mail receiving MTA server;
* adheres to the RFC standards;
* all currently used SMTP verbs are implemented;
* dead verbs are left out;
* is delivering messages in Maildir format;
* the configuration is simple and understandable;
* uses domains, users and aliases derived from Postfix;
* has seemless integration with Courier-IMAP configuration;
* all configuration details reside in MySQL database;
* has logging to database;
* has builtin spam heuristics;
* optional will use external spam databases.

Current status:
